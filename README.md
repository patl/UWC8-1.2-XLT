Hello :) 

I used XLT tool for creating this scripts.
Download and install this tool from here: https://www.xceptance.com/en/xlt/download 

---Installation---

To install the XLT Script Developer extension for Firefox, you need to:
1. Start Firefox.
2. Click File>Open File.
3. Navigate to the <XLT>/tools directory and select the .xpi file. The add-on installation dialog box appears.
4. Click Install to finish and restart your Firefox browser.
4.1. Alternatively, you can drag the .xpi file onto the Firefox window.

---Setup---

1. Open the Script Developer window via the Firefox Tools menu.
2. Click on XLT Script Developer.
3. Xlt tool will run.

If you start XLT Script Developer for the very first time, you will be asked to configure a test suite. 
Click OK, then select a directory that contains a XLT test suite or, if no test suite exists yet,
select a target directory where a new test suite should be created.

Download Scripts from GitHub reposetory.
And Import this scripts to XLT tool.
Click on Run...
Enjoy :)
